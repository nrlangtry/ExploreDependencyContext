# CoreConsoleAppLogging
.NET Core Console App w/ static logging added

.NET Core Console projects don't have as many out-of-the-box logging features as MVC projects.  This is the start of a new Console project w/ logging & appSettings already added.  This uses the same static Logger class as the CoreAppFramework repo.
